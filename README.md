Bitcoin-Trader
==============

In 2013, I created a bitcoin trading application which connects to a user's account (currently mine) on Mt.Gox. It then can acquire all of the current account information (used in the portfolio) and can trade bitcoins. I also use a google news api to access their recent news about bitcoins which I display under the news tab. I create the text alert feature through sending a text through email, and using the python email library to do so.

I used the Mt.Gox API (included in submission) and the jsonAscii library (also included in the submission). I also used several other libraries, of which their easy_install directions are below:

easy_install pycrypto
easy_install lxml
easy_install simplejson
easy_install getpass
easy_install base64
easy_install hmac
easy_install hashlib
easy_install urllib
easy_install json
